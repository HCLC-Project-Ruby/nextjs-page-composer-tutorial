# Page Composer Tutorial Sample

The sample contains three parts and uses following Layout and Widget example throughout the tutorial:

| Type     | ID | IDENTIFIER |
| -------- | -- | ---------- |
| Layout (container widget) | -8010 | my-test-product-page |
| Widget | -8517 | my-sample-site-widget |



### Dataload

The dataload contains sample data for a container widget (layout template) and a site level widget.


### NextJs

The NextJs folder contains a sample implementation of loaded widget/container widget from aforementioned **Dataload** section. It has same folder structure as NextJs Store project.

### toolingUI

The toolingui folder contains tooling UI sample implementation of the loaded layout template(container widget) and the sample site level widget.


**Dataload** is preferable done before **NextJs** and **ToolingUI**.
