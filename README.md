Page Composer Tutorial Sample


The sample container three parts

### Dataload

The dataload contains sample data for a container widget (layout template) and a site level widget.


### NextJs

The NextJs folder contains a sample implementation of loaded widget/container widget from aforementioned **Dataload** section. It has same folder structure as NextJs Store project.

### toolingUI

The toolingui folder contains tooling UI sample implementation of the loaded layout template(container widget) and the sample site level widget.


**Dataload** is preferable done before **NextJs** and **ToolingUI**.
